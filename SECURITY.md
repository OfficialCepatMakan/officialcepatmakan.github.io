# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, contact us privately at cepatmakanofficial@gmail.com or through our secure reporting form (if available).

Include as much detail as possible:
- A clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce it  
- Potential impact  
- Any suggested fixes (if you have one)

We’ll respond as soon as possible — usually within a few days — and keep you updated until it’s resolved.

## Responsible Disclosure
We appreciate responsible disclosure. Please:
- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before publicly sharing it.
- Avoid testing on live systems without permission.
- Do not access, modify, or delete user data.

## A Note of Thanks
Security researchers make the internet less cursed.  
We respect that. Seriously — thanks for helping keep our project safe.
